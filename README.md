Digital Methods Exam Project completed with other 3 students. Each exam number corresponds to one of the four students, but all answers are written jointly by the group, and assigned exam numbers are arbitrary.

### Purpose of the research

Due to a series of recent social, political and economic events, such as Brexit, the
COVID-19 pandemic, the energy crisis, the war in Ukraine, on top of recent resignations of
prime ministers (PMs) and the passing away of Queen Elizabeth II, the United Kingdom
(UK) has suffered a continuous inflation rise, experiencing big energy shocks and labour
shortages (Bruce, 2023). To map the discourse on the issue, we aim to answer the following
research question: How have parliamentary actors (Members of the Parliament (MPs),
parties, ministry) involved with state economics and finances and/or related debates in the
UK been discussing the high levels of inflation on Twitter since January 2022?
We will follow the digital methods methodology suggested by Blok et al. (2022) for
conducting quali-quantitative research in three steps: Data Collection, Data Exploration and
Data Analysis. This approach is understood as “the repurposing of the inscriptions generated
by the media for the study of collective phenomena” (Venturini et al., 2018) and allows for
the intersection of particular methods and the emergence of new research questions as the
research process evolves.
